Textures for run-flattening.py

These are copied from the default Minecraft 1.17.1 resource pack, a merge of these 2 directories:
minecraft/textures/block
minecraft/textures/item

It needs weeding out as it currently contains many non-placeable items as well as duplicate/redundant orientations.
Some blocks may also be missing or need renaming to match the actual minecraft resource names.
You'll know because it will give error: "Missing texture file ......."
